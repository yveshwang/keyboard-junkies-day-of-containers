Pure HTML/CSS/JS based presentation. 

* HTML and CSS based on John Polacek, "What the heck is responsive web design?" http://johnpolacek.github.io/WhatTheHeckIsResponsiveWebDesign-impressjs/#/title
* JS framework is based on impress.js http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/


Apologies for the `jquery` dependency and also the age of the JS framework.
